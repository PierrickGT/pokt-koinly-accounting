# graphql-query-template

Template repository to kickstart a project to query GraphQL endpoints.

## Development

This template uses [graphql-request](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-request) to query GraphQL endpoints.

### GraphQL Request

An example query is available in `request.ts`. Run it with:

```
yarn start
```

### Code quality

[Prettier](https://prettier.io) is used to format TypeScript code. Use it by running:

```
yarn format
```
Or per file:

```
yarn format:file request.ts
```
